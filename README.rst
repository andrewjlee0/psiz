=======================================
PsiZ: A Psychological Embedding Package
=======================================

What's in a name?
-----------------
The name PsiZ (pronounced like the word *size*) is meant to serve as shorthard
for the term *psychological embedding*. The greek letter Psi is often used to
represent the field of psychology and the matrix variable **Z** is often used in
computer vision to denote an embedding.

Purpose
-------
TODO

PsiZ provides the computational tools to infer an continuous, multivariate
representation for a set of stimuli using ordinal similarity relations.

The simplest similarity relation is a triplet of the form:

transform ordinal similarity relations
into a continuous, multivariate representation.
